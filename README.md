# 1942Game-repo

## Repository for Class Project 1942Game
This repository hosts code for a one player 2D shooter game remaking classic 1942 arcade game, a class project undertaken in the first year of university by [Enica King](https://github.com/enicaking) and [Estéfany González](https://github.com/estefanygonzalez). This allowed us to develop our Programming skills in Python and gained an understnading of OOP. 

This project was made possible with the [pyxel package](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) developed by kitao and uses as a base framework the package's example project [shooter](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel/blob/main/python/pyxel/examples/09_shooter.py).

## Installation Prerequisites
* Latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Optional, an IDE such as [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) which will have stricter hardware requirements, i.e. minimum 2GB of RAM, 3.5GB disk space

## Installation Steps
After successful installation of Python, the steps needed to run the code are as follows:

1. Open project in Pycharm
2. Set local interpreter.
  * Windows: Use existing folder and navigate to .venv > Scripts > python.exe
  * macOS/Linux: Create new virtual environment and use requirements.txt to download necessary packages using `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`
